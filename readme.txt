These changes will compile a new custom kernel for proxmox (or any other linux distribution for that matter)
which will update megaraid_sas drivers to suport Shared Perc8 (shared storage on VRTX servers).

This process is not for the fient of heart, and will require some blind faith in regards stability.
Testing will be done to ensure this in the future, and, other configuration changes with this kernel
config are likely to occur.
